Text-to-Speech with Python
In today's digital age, the ability to convert text into spoken words is becoming increasingly valuable. Text-to-speech (TTS) technology enables applications to communicate with users through natural-sounding voices, enhancing user experience and accessibility. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the world of TTS using Python, utilizing XTTS from the TTS library to convert text to speech effortlessly. XTTS is a Voice generation model that lets you clone voices into different languages by using just a quick 6-second audio clip.
Prerequisites:
Before we begin, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need to install the TTS library along with sounddevice and soundfile. You can install them using pip:
pip install TTS sounddevice soundfile
Getting Started:
First, let's import the necessary modules:
from TTS.tts.configs.xtts_config import XttsConfig
from TTS.tts.models.xtts import Xtts
import sounddevice as sd
import soundfile as sf
Creating the Text-to-Speech Model:
Next, we'll initialize the TTS model and load the configuration:
text = '''
this is just a test.
'''

# Initialize TTS with the target model name
config = XttsConfig()
config.load_json("./models/v2.0.2/config.json")
model = Xtts.init_from_config(config)
model.load_checkpoint(config, checkpoint_dir="./models/v2.0.2", eval=True)
model.cpu()
Generating Speech:
Now, let's synthesize the text into speech using the initialized model:
voice = './voice.wav'
sr = 23000

# Synthesize text
output = model.synthesize(text=text, config=config, speaker_wav=voice, language='en')
Playing the Speech:
Finally, let's play the synthesized speech using sounddevice and save it to a file:
# Play the speech
sd.wait()
sd.play(output['wav'], samplerate=sr)

# Save the output to a WAV file
sf.write('output.wav', output['wav'], sr)
Conclusion:
And there you have it! You've just created a simple text-to-speech application using Python and the TTS library. Feel free to explore further and customize the TTS settings to suit your needs. With this newfound knowledge, you can integrate tePxt-to-speech capabilities into your projects, whether it's for enhancing accessibility or building interactive voice applications. Happy coding!
